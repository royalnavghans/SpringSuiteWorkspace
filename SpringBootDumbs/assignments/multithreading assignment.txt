multi-threading
1) Create a thread which prints 1 to 10. After printing 5, there should 
be a delay of 5000 milliseconds before printing 6.

2) Create two threads, one thread to display all even numbers between 1 & 20, 
another to display odd numbers between 1 & 20.
Note: Display all even numbers followed by odd numbers
Hint: use join

3) Create three threads- with different priorities – MAX, MIN, NORM- 
and start the threads at the same time. Observe the completion of the threads.

4) Create two threads and assign names ‘Scooby’ and ‘Shaggy’ to the two threads. 
Display both thread names.

5) store colours in the form of an array
ex: String colours[]={"white","blue","black","green","red","yellow"};
display all colours repeatedly by generating colour index from Random class. 
If the random colour index matches to red stop display.
Note: perform this task by implementing Runnable interface.

6) 1. Create class of SalesPersons as a thread that will display fives sales persons name.
2. Create a class as Days as other Thread that has array of seven days.
3. Call the instance of SalesPersons in Days and start both the threads
4. suspend SalesPersons on Sunday and resume on wednesday .
